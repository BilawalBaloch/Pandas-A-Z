Data Structures in Pandas
Pandas introduces two primary data structures: Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional).

Series (1D)
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floats, Python objects, etc.).

Example 1: Basic Series Creation

import pandas as pd

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(x)
print()

var = pd.Series(x)
print(var)

Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5
dtype: int64

Example 2: Series with Custom Index and Data Type

üêº Pandas-Mastery: A Comprehensive Guide to Data Analysis
This repository provides a practical, hands-on guide to mastering the Pandas library in Python, essential for data analysis, manipulation, and cleaning. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into data science or an experienced practitioner looking for a quick reference, this project offers clear, runnable examples for a wide array of Pandas functionalities.

The core of this project is the pandas_mastery.py script, which demonstrates key operations using a synthetic dataset, ensuring the code is immediately runnable without external dependencies (apart from the libraries themselves).

üöÄ Features Covered
This project systematically explores the following aspects of Pandas:

Data Generation: Creating synthetic datasets for self-contained examples.

Series Operations: Understanding 1D data structures, creation, indexing, and arithmetic.

DataFrame Creation: Building 2D tabular data from various sources (lists, dictionaries, Series).

Basic Data Inspection: Using .head(), .tail(), .info(), .describe(), .shape, .columns, .dtypes, and .value_counts() to get a quick overview of your data.

Data Selection & Indexing: Mastering .loc[] (label-based), .iloc[] (integer-position-based), and powerful Boolean indexing for filtering.

Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values (.isnull(), .dropna(), .fillna()) and duplicate rows (.duplicated(), .drop_duplicates()).

Data Manipulation & Transformation: Renaming columns, creating new features, and applying custom functions (.apply(), .map()).

Grouping and Aggregation: Summarizing data using groupby() with various aggregation functions (.mean(), .sum(), .count(), .agg()).

Merging, Joining, and Concatenating: Combining DataFrames using pd.merge() (inner, left, right, outer joins) and pd.concat().

Reshaping Data: Transforming data layouts with pivot_table() (wide format) and melt() (long format).

Time Series Data: Working with date and time data, including resampling, shifting, and rolling window calculations.

Categorical Data: Efficiently managing and operating on categorical variables.

Basic Data Visualization: Quick visual insights using Pandas' built-in plotting functionalities (powered by Matplotlib).

Saving Data: Exporting processed DataFrames to CSV (and Excel, with openpyxl).

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
To run the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python: Make sure you have Python (3.7+) installed.

Libraries: You'll need pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pandas-Mastery.git
cd Pandas-Mastery

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if you fork it.)

Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

(If you want to save to Excel, you might also need openpyxl: pip install openpyxl)

Running the Code
The entire project's examples are contained within a single Python script.

Execute the Script:

python pandas_mastery.py

The script will print outputs to your console for each section, demonstrating the functionality. Plots generated by the visualization section will appear in separate windows.

üìñ Example Usage
When you run pandas_mastery.py, you'll see a structured output in your terminal. Each section is clearly marked, and print() statements are used to show the results of various Pandas operations.

For instance, after "--- 5. Data Selection & Indexing ---", you'll see outputs demonstrating how to select columns, rows, and filter data using different methods.

--- 5. Data Selection & Indexing ---

5.1 Selecting a single column ('Value_A'):
0    89.0
1    21.0
2    36.0
3    53.0
4    49.0
Name: Value_A, dtype: float64

... (and so on for other examples)

You can specify a custom index and data type for your Series.

import pandas as pd

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var = pd.Series(x, index=["a", "b", "c", "d"], dtype="float")
print(var)

Output:

a    1.0
b    2.0
c    3.0
d    4.0
dtype: float64

Example 3: Series with Same Data and Custom Index

import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series("bilawal", index=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(s)

Output:

1    bilawal
2    bilawal
3    bilawal
4    bilawal
5    bilawal
6    bilawal
dtype: object

Example 4: Handling Missing Data in Series (Arithmetic Operations)

When performing arithmetic operations on Series with misaligned indices, Pandas automatically introduces NaN (Not a Number) for missing values.

import pandas as pd

s1 = pd.Series(12, index=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
s2 = pd.Series(12, index=[2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8])
print(s1 + s2)

Output:

1     NaN
2    24.0
3    24.0
4     NaN
5    24.0
6    24.0
7    24.0
8    24.0
9     NaN
dtype: float64

DataFrame (2D)
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It's similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.

Example 1: Creating DataFrame from a List with Custom Index

import pandas as pd

data_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
names = ["Bilal", "Sahid", "Ali", "Ahmed", "Yasir", "Adnan"]
var = pd.DataFrame(data_list, index=names) # Note: Index is for rows here
print(type(var))
print(var)

Output:

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
         0
Bilal    1
Sahid    2
Ali      3
Ahmed    4
Yasir    5
Adnan    6

Example 2: Creating DataFrame from a Dictionary

Dictionaries are a common way to create DataFrames, where keys become column names.

import pandas as pd

dic = {"countries": ["UK", "USA", "UAE", "KSA"],
       "FULL NAME": ["UNITEDKINGDOM", "UNITED STATE", "UNITED ARAB EMIR", "KINGDUM OF S.A"]}
var = pd.DataFrame(dic)
print(var)

Output:

  countries         FULL NAME
0        UK     UNITEDKINGDOM
1       USA      UNITED STATE
2       UAE  UNITED ARAB EMIR
3       KSA    KINGDUM OF S.A

Example 3: Accessing a Column in a DataFrame

import pandas as pd

dic = {"countries": ["UK", "USA", "UAE", "KSA"],
       "FULL NAME": ["UNITEDKINGDOM", "UNITED STATE", "UNITED ARAB EMIR", "KINGDUM OF S.A"]}
var = pd.DataFrame(dic)
print(var["FULL NAME"])

Output:

0       UNITEDKINGDOM
1        UNITED STATE
2    UNITED ARAB EMIR
3      KINGDUM OF S.A
Name: FULL NAME, dtype: object

Example 4: Creating DataFrame from Series

You can combine multiple Series into a DataFrame.

import pandas as pd

sr = {"r": pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
      "s": pd.Series([10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19])}
var = pd.DataFrame(sr)
print(var)

Output:

   r   s
0  1  10
1  2  11
2  3  12
3  4  13
4  5  14
5  6  15
6  7  17
7  8  18
8  9  19

Arithmetic Operations
Pandas DataFrames support various arithmetic operations between columns or with scalar values.

Example 1: Basic DataFrame for Arithmetic

import pandas as pd

dic = {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]}
var = pd.DataFrame(dic)
print(var)

Output:

   a  b
0  1  7
1  2  8
2  3  9
3  4  1
4  5  2
5  6  3

Example 2: Adding two columns to create a new one

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["c"] = var["a"] + var["b"]
print(var)

Output:

   a  b   c
0  1  7   8
1  2  8  10
2  3  9  12
3  4  1   5
4  5  2   7
5  6  3   9

Example 3: Subtracting two columns

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["c"] = var["a"] - var["b"]
print(var)

Output:

   a  b  c
0  1  7 -6
1  2  8 -6
2  3  9 -6
3  4  1  3
4  5  2  3
5  6  3  3

Example 4: Modulo operation between columns

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["c"] = var["a"] % var["b"]
print(var)

Output:

   a  b  c
0  1  7  1
1  2  8  2
2  3  9  3
3  4  1  0
4  5  2  1
5  6  3  0

Example 5: Floor division between columns

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["c"] = var["a"] // var["b"]
print(var)

Output:

   a  b  c
0  1  7  0
1  2  8  0
2  3  9  0
3  4  1  4
4  5  2  2
5  6  3  2

Example 6: Exponentiation between columns

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["c"] = var["a"] ** var["b"]
print(var)

Output:

   a  b      c
0  1  7      1
1  2  8    256
2  3  9  19683
3  4  1      4
4  5  2     25
5  6  3    216

Example 7: Boolean Comparison

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 10, 4, 50, 6], "b": [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]})
var["TRUE/FALSE"] = var["a"] < 10
print(var)

Output:

    a  b  TRUE/FALSE
0   1  7        True
1   2  8        True
2  10  9       False
3   4  1        True
4  50  2       False
5   6  3        True

Data Manipulation
Inserting Data
You can insert new columns into a DataFrame at a specific position   . 

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "B": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]})
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(var)

# Insert column 'c' at position 2 (0-indexed), copying values from column 'A'
var.insert(2, "c", var["A"])
print("\nDataFrame after inserting 'c':")
print(var)

Output:

Original DataFrame:
   A   B
0  1   6
1  2   7
2  3   8
3  4   9
4  5  10

DataFrame after inserting 'c':
   A   B   c
0  1   6   1
1  2   7   2
2  3   8   3
3  4   9   4
4  5  10   5

Slicing Data
Slicing allows you to select a range of rows from a DataFrame.

Example 1: Slicing from the beginning

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available in the same directory or path
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print(var[:6]) # Selects rows from index 0 up to (but not including) 6

Example 2: Slicing a specific range

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available in the same directory or path
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print(var[5:11]) # Selects rows from index 5 up to (but not including) 11

Deleting Data
You can remove columns from a DataFrame using pop() or del.

Example 1: Using pop() to remove a column

pop() removes a column and returns it as a Series.

import pandas as pd

bilawal = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "B": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "C": [2, 4, 6, 8, 1]})
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(bilawal)

a = bilawal.pop("B")
print("\nRemoved Series 'B':")
print(a)
print("\nDataFrame after pop('B'):")
print(bilawal)

Output:

Original DataFrame:
   A   B  C
0  1   6  2
1  2   7  4
2  3   8  6
3  4   9  8
4  5  10  1

Removed Series 'B':
0     6
1     7
2     8
3     9
4    10
Name: B, dtype: int64

DataFrame after pop('B'):
   A  C
0  1  2
1  2  4
2  3  6
3  4  8
4  5  1

Example 2: Using del to remove a column

del removes a column in place.

import pandas as pd

var = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "B": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "C": [2, 4, 6, 8, 1]})
print("Original DataFrame:")
print(var)

del var["A"]
print("\nDataFrame after del var['A']:")
print(var)

Output:

Original DataFrame:
   A   B  C
0  1   6  2
1  2   7  4
2  3   8  6
3  4   9  8
4  5  10  1

DataFrame after del var['A']:
    B  C
0   6  2
1   7  4
2   8  6
3   9  8
4  10  1

Accessing Rows and Columns (.loc, .iloc)
Pandas provides .loc for label-based indexing and .iloc for integer-based indexing.

Example 1: Selecting specific rows and columns using .loc

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print(var.loc[[6, 7], ["City", "Country"]])

Output (example):

        City        Country
6  Lake Ana  Pitcairn Islands
7   Kimport          Bulgaria

Example 2: Selecting specific rows using .loc

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print(var.loc[[3, 7]])

Example 3: Selecting specific rows using .iloc

.iloc uses integer positions for both rows and columns.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print(var.iloc[[2, 3], :]) # Selects rows at integer positions 2 and 3, all columns

Working with CSV Files
Pandas makes it easy to read from and write to CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.

Creating CSV Files
You can export a DataFrame to a CSV file using to_csv().

import pandas as pd

dic = {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "b": [2, 4, 6, 7, 8], "c": [3, 6, 9, 3, 6]}
var = pd.DataFrame(dic)
print("DataFrame to be saved:")
print(var)

# Save to CSV
var.to_csv("pandas_course.csv")
print("\n'pandas_course.csv' created successfully.")

Output:

   a  b  c
0  1  2  3
1  2  4  6
2  3  6  9
3  4  7  3
4  5  8  6

'pandas_course.csv' created successfully.

Reading CSV Files
You can read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame using read_csv().

Example 1: Reading an entire CSV file

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'covid.csv' is available in the same directory or path
# Note: For large files, printing the entire DataFrame with print(df.to_string())
# might exceed output limits in some environments (like Jupyter notebooks).
df = pd.read_csv("covid.csv")
print(df)

Example 2: Reading a specific number of rows

Use the nrows parameter to read only the first N rows.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'covid.csv' is available
df = pd.read_csv("covid.csv", nrows=1)
print(df)

Output (first row example):

  Direction  Year        Date   Weekday Country Commodity Transport_Mode  \
0   Exports  2015  01/01/2015  Thursday     All       All            All

  Measure      Value  Cumulative
0       $  104000000   104000000

Example 3: Reading specific columns

Use the usecols parameter to load only desired columns.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'covid.csv' is available
df = pd.read_csv("covid.csv", usecols=["Year"])
print(df)

Output (example):

        Year
0       2015
1       2015
2       2015
3       2015
4       2015
...      ...
111433  2021
111434  2021
111435  2021
111436  2021
111437  2021

[111438 rows x 1 columns]

Handling Missing Data
Missing data (often represented as NaN - Not a Number) is common in real-world datasets. Pandas provides robust tools to manage it.

dropna()
The dropna() method is used to remove rows or columns containing missing values.

Example 1: Dropping rows with any NaN values

By default, dropna() removes any row that contains at least one NaN value.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
print("Original DataFrame shape:", var.shape)
df_cleaned = var.dropna()
print("DataFrame after dropna() (default 'any'):")
print(df_cleaned.shape) # Print shape to show rows removed
print(df_cleaned.head()) # Show first few rows of cleaned data

Example 2: how="any" (explicitly)

This is the default behavior, removing a row if any NaN is present.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
df_any = var.dropna(how="any")
print("DataFrame after dropna(how='any'):")
print(df_any.shape)
print(df_any.head())

Notes on dropna() parameters:

how="all": Drops a row/column only if all its values are NaN.

subset=["column_name"]: Drops rows where NaN values are present only in the specified column(s).

inplace=True: Modifies the DataFrame directly instead of returning a new one.

thresh=N: Requires at least N non-NaN values for a row/column to be kept.

fillna()
The fillna() method is used to replace missing values with a specified value or method.

Example 1: Filling NaN with a single value

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
# Introduce some NaNs for demonstration if the CSV is clean
var.loc[0, 'Phone 2'] = None
var.loc[2, 'Website'] = None

print("DataFrame with introduced NaNs:")
print(var.head())

df_filled = var.fillna("python")
print("\nDataFrame after fillna('python'):")
print(df_filled.head())

Example 2: Filling NaN with different values for different columns

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
# Introduce some NaNs for demonstration
var.loc[0, 'Country'] = None
var.loc[1, 'Phone 1'] = None

print("DataFrame with introduced NaNs:")
print(var.head())

df_filled_col = var.fillna({"Country": "Sri Lanka", "Phone 1": "034343434"})
print("\nDataFrame after fillna with dictionary:")
print(df_filled_col.head())

Example 3: Filling NaN using forward fill (ffill)

ffill propagates the last valid observation forward to next valid observation.

import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'customers-100.csv' is available
var = pd.read_csv("customers-100.csv")
# Introduce some NaNs for demonstration
var.loc[1, 'City'] = None
var.loc[3, 'City'] = None

print("DataFrame with introduced NaNs:")
print(var.iloc[0:5, [5, 6]]) # Show relevant columns

df_ffill = var.fillna(method="ffill")
print("\nDataFrame after fillna(method='ffill'):")
print(df_ffill.iloc[0:5, [5, 6]])

Getting Started
To run these examples:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

(Replace your-username/your-repo-name.git with the actual path to your repository.)

Install Pandas:
If you don't have Pandas installed, you can do so using pip:

pip install pandas

(You might also need openpyxl if you plan to work with Excel files: pip install openpyxl)

Obtain Data Files:
The examples use covid.csv and customers-100.csv. Please ensure these files are present in the same directory as your Python scripts, or update the file paths in the code accordingly. You can find sample customers-100.csv files online or create one for testing. For covid.csv, you'd need a similar dataset.

Run a specific example:
Each code snippet is self-contained. You can copy and paste them into a Python interpreter, a Jupyter Notebook, or save them as individual .py files and run them from your terminal:

python your_script_name.py

# üêº Pandas Data Analysis & Data Science Core Operations

This repository contains a comprehensive Python script (`pandas_data_analysis.py`) demonstrating essential Pandas functionalities for **data analysis** and **data science**. It covers everything from basic DataFrame creation and data loading to advanced manipulation, aggregation, and fundamental visualization techniques.

Whether you're new to Pandas or looking for a quick reference, this guide provides practical examples for common data tasks.

-----

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this code, you'll need Python installed along with the following libraries:

  * **pandas**: The core library for data manipulation.
  * **numpy**: For numerical operations, often used alongside Pandas.
  * **matplotlib**: For basic plotting (Pandas' built-in `.plot()` uses this).
  * **seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization (imported, but not extensively used in the built-in `.plot()` examples; good to have for advanced plotting).

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

-----

## üìù Code Overview

The script is logically divided into several sections, each focusing on a key aspect of Pandas for data analysis:

### 1\. Introduction to Pandas & Series/DataFrame Creation

This section introduces Pandas' fundamental data structures: **Series** (1D labeled arrays) and **DataFrames** (2D labeled tables). It shows how to create these objects from Python lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays, including how to define custom indices.

### 2\. Data Loading & Saving

Learn how to read data from common formats like **CSV** (`pd.read_csv()`) and how to save your processed DataFrames back to CSV (`.to_csv()`). While Excel examples are commented out, the structure is provided for reference.

### 3\. Basic Data Inspection & Information

Before diving into analysis, it's crucial to understand your data. This section covers functions like:

  * `.head()` and `.tail()`: To quickly view the top and bottom rows.
  * `.info()`: For a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.
  * `.describe()`: To generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
  * `.shape`, `.columns`, `.dtypes`: To get the dimensions, column names, and data types.
  * `.value_counts()`: To count unique occurrences in a Series.

### 4\. Data Selection & Indexing

Master how to access specific parts of your DataFrame using various indexing methods:

  * **Column selection**: `df['column_name']` and `df[['col1', 'col2']]`.
  * **Label-based indexing (`.loc[]`)**: Selecting data by explicit row and column labels.
  * **Integer-position based indexing (`.iloc[]`)**: Selecting data by numerical positions.
  * **Boolean indexing**: Powerful filtering capabilities to select rows based on conditions (e.g., `df[df['age'] > 25]`), including using `&` (AND), `|` (OR), and `.isin()`.

### 5\. Data Cleaning

Real-world data is rarely perfect. This section demonstrates how to handle common data cleaning tasks:

  * **Missing values**: Using `.isnull().sum()` to identify NaNs, and methods like `.dropna()` to remove rows/columns with missing data, or `.fillna()` to replace them with specific values (e.g., mean, 0, or using forward/backward fill).
  * **Duplicate values**: Identifying and removing duplicate rows using `.drop_duplicates()`.

### 6\. Data Manipulation & Transformation

Transform your data into a more suitable format for analysis:

  * **Renaming columns**: Using `.rename()`.
  * **Creating new columns**: Deriving new features based on existing ones.
  * **Applying functions**: Using `.apply()` for element-wise or row/column-wise operations, and `.map()` for value substitution.

### 7\. Grouping and Aggregation

Summarize your data efficiently, similar to SQL's `GROUP BY` clause:

  * **Grouping by single/multiple columns**: `df.groupby('column')`.
  * **Aggregating with various functions**: Calculating `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`, `count()`, and custom aggregations using `.agg()`.

### 8\. Merging, Joining, and Concatenating

Combine multiple DataFrames:

  * **Merging (`pd.merge()`)**: Performing SQL-style joins (inner, left, right, outer) based on common keys.
  * **Concatenating (`pd.concat()`)**: Stacking DataFrames vertically (rows) or horizontally (columns).

### 9\. Reshaping Data (Pivot, Melt)

Change the layout of your data for better analysis or visualization:

  * **Pivot Table**: Aggregating data and creating new columns from unique values, similar to Excel pivot tables.
  * **Melt (Unpivot)**: Transforming columns into rows, converting "wide" data into "long" format, often useful for plotting.

### 10\. Time Series Data

Essential operations for working with date and time data:

  * **Resampling**: Changing the frequency of time series data (e.g., daily to weekly).
  * **Shifting**: Moving data points forward or backward in time (useful for calculating changes).
  * **Rolling window calculations**: Applying functions over a defined sliding window (e.g., moving averages).

### 11\. Categorical Data

Efficiently manage and operate on categorical variables:

  * Converting columns to the `category` dtype for memory efficiency and specific operations.
  * Adding/removing categories.

### 12\. Basic Data Visualization

Leverage Pandas' built-in plotting capabilities (which use Matplotlib) for quick visual insights:

  * **Histograms**: To visualize distribution.
  * **Bar plots**: For categorical data counts.
  * **Scatter plots**: To show relationships between two numerical variables.
  * **Box plots**: To visualize score distributions across different groups.

### 13\. Advanced Operations and Utilities

A collection of other useful Pandas functions:

  * **Iterating over rows**: (`.iterrows()`, generally for small datasets).
  * **Sampling data**: Randomly selecting a subset of rows.
  * **Ranking**: Assigning ranks to values in a Series.
  * **Sorting values**: Arranging DataFrame rows based on column values.
